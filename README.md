# Multiagent_traffic_light_sytem
This file shows the method of making a traffic simulation

1. First create file roadNodes.nod.xml
Work :- This file create the nodes needed for making roads. We can define a node to be traffic node.

2. Second Create file roadEdge.edg.xml
Work :- This file uses the node id defined in the 1. to join the nodes and make road. We can define roadtypes in this file like 2 lane etc.


3. Now run command netconvert --node-files=roadNodes.nod.xml --edge-files=roadEdge.edg.xml --output-file=roads.net.xml
This helped in making roads.net.xml file.
or
Make netc.cfg file and run below command
netconvert â€“c roadsConnection.netc.cfg

4. Now create roadConnection.sumo.cfg file
This file contains the input fils such as .nod.xml and link them to other files helping to generate gui

Run sumo-gui -c roadConnection.sumo.cfg
This creates gui

4. Create python file that generates route of the cars.
